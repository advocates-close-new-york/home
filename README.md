# Computational Methods for Corporate Lawyers

Applications of machine intelligence to board and related replacement functions. 

## Overview

Technologists have among themselves a mantra. They say: `DRY` for the phrase
`do not repeat yourself`. A world in which human beings do not repeat themselves
is a world in which they are able to say a thing once and then move on to the 
next thing. Their progress compounds upon itself. The results are, of course, 
breathtaking. Almost no part of American life has not been influenced in some
way by their success. Almost.

The corporate manager has been vilified for hundreds of years. Today, corporations
have more in common with a passenger airliner than they do with a `business` of 
any kind. Corporations are complex. We do not fly airplanes with nothing more than
our wits. We should not run companies that way either.

Strongly typed data has a number of advanteous properties. In the sense that all of
machine learning arises out of linear algebra, the ability to retain some amount of
information as to the domain on which an object may be sensibly defined is useful. 
The math becomes sharper when the things we are taking to be variables are 
appropriately defined. Dimensionality problems become less pressing. Model sizes 
become relatively smaller.

There are, of course, reasons for why data science researchers do not manipulate their
input data. We are not constrained in what we do to our data. Ideally, the more we are
able to manipulate, regulate or otherwise generalize the data that we have, the greater
will be our improvement along at least two margins of interest. The first is 
mathematical and arises from the regularity in what we take as data as compared do what
is typical in machine learning workflows. Legal documents are drafted with intentionality.
They are not concerned with unknowable subject matters. It is possible to reason about
equivalences between two statements of legal import. What becomes possible as a result
is important.

Because we can define identities between otherwise distinct objects, we are able to 
define the origins of an algebra. Recall that `equations` are simply statements of
equality--they are statements as to the equivalence of two things. When we know that
two things ought to be equivalent, the observation that they are not becomes 
meaningful. For our purposes, it is this one observation--the observation of a 
difference--that matters. 

Keeping the math manageable is important because all data processing must occur, if
at all, then on a single device. We do not expose client information to others. As a 
result, we will not have access to any kind of latest and greatest in the way of 
AI. We will therefore need to do our own math.
